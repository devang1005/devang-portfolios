  heroIntroduction: 'Engineering scalable AI solutions from data to deployment.',
  biography: `I'm an AI Engineer focused on building practical, production-ready AI systems. My work covers the complete lifecycle of AI solutions — from data collection and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, deployment, and optimization.

I have hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, working with structured data as well as text-based problems. I've built and experimented with neural networks, NLP models, and LLM-powered applications, applying techniques such as model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and AI automation.

My technical stack includes Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, ML/DL frameworks, and data visualization tools. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing systems that are scalable, reproducible, and aligned with real business use cases.

Through academic, personal, and project-based work, I've gained strong experience in data analysis, predictive modeling, deep learning workflows, and generative AI applications, with an emphasis on solving real-world problems rather than building isolated models.

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to real AI products, grow as an AI engineer, and work on impactful deep learning and generative AI solutions.`,
  approach: `My photography is guided by three principles: authenticity, composition, and light. I believe the best images emerge when subjects feel comfortable and genuine, when composition guides the viewer's eye naturally, and when light reveals the essence of the moment.

Whether working on editorial assignments or commercial projects, I strive to create images that transcend their immediate purpose and become lasting visual statements.`,
